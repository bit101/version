What version do I have of ___?

You've been there...

```
java -v // unrecognized option
java -V // unrecognized option
java --version // unrecognized option
java --Version // unrecognized option
java -Version // unrecognized option
java -version // 1.8.0_262
```

There's no standard.

```
gcc --version
node -v
node --version
python -V
perl -v
perl --version
go version
lua -v
rustc --version
```

`version` is a simple, easily updateable script that tells you what version you are on.

```
version node   // v14.70
version gcc    // 10.1.0
version java   // 1.8.0_262
version pascal // 'pascal' does not seem to be installed.
```

## FAQ

Q: Couldn't you just run all the different variations on an unknown command and see which one works?

A: Yes. But running various random commands on somoene else's computer and seeing what happens is not a best practice.

---

Q: What operating systems does this work on?

A: It should work on any \*nix based system. It's been pretty thoroughly tested on versions of Linux and Macos. There will be some differences across platforms though. See the questions below.

---

Q: Why does it give me an error on command _____?

A: Feel free to file an issue and I'll look into it. Some tools have different variants that behave differently. For example, `sed --version` works fine on my Linux machine, but `sed` does not seem to have any version argument at all on my Mac.

---

Q: Why does it say I don't have a program installed when I know I do?

A: Again, some tools work differently on different systems. For example, on Linux, I can launch Firefox from the command line with `firefox`. But on Mac, I have to type `open -a Firefox`, because on Mac Firefox is not really a command line program. Instead, `Firefox.app` is a special folder containing the executable `firefox` nested a few levels deep. But since that's not in the search path, `version` cannot find it. If you can launch the program Foo by typing `foo` on the command line, then `version foo` should work (if it's in the list). There are no plans to make version work for Mac `.app` programs.
